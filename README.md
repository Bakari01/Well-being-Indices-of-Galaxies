# Well-being-Indices-of-Galaxies
This project seeks to analyze the well-being of galaxies given 80 variables that characterize the demographic and socio-economic situation of 181 galaxies over a period of at most 26 years. A composite index is given that measures their well-being. 
However, the demographic and socio-economic variables that influence this index is not known. We
seek to determine, what makes the galaxies better off?
We would like you to use the data and:
1. Tell us which variables best explain the variance of the well-being index
2. Determine the future well-being values of the galaxies
Attached herein is:
* 1. A report that discusses the demographic and socio-economic determinants of the galaxies'
wellbeing.
Submission Format: The report should be a pdf of a slide presentation of not more than 5 slides
* 2. The predicted future well-being index values with the highest possible level of certainty using
data in the validation dataset.
Submission Format: A csv file Saved as "firstname_lastname_DSA.csv" containing:
